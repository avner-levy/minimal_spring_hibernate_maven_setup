Once a while I find myself with a need to test some hibernate feature in a standalone setup.
This project serves as a starting point to a standalone spring / jpa application.
It uses build time aspectJ weaving (for spring aspects / transaction management).
It uses a temporary embedded database but you can switch to what ever you want.
Run "mvn install" to compile the project with the tests.
Run "mvn exec:java" to run the main application.
Enjoy,
